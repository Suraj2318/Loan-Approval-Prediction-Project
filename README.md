### **Loan Approval Prediction Project**  

This repository contains the Loan Approval Prediction project, part of my data science portfolio, completed during an online hackathon organized by **Analytics Vidhya**. The project's goal was to automate the loan approval process by building a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on customer data. The evaluation metric used was **accuracy**, with the best performance achieved using **Logistic Regression (0.7847)**, followed by **Random Forest (0.7778)** and **XGBoost (0.7778)**. The **Decision Tree** algorithm performed the worst with an accuracy of **0.6458**.

### **Project Highlights**  
This project covers the entire data science workflow, including:  
- **Problem Statement**: Automating loan eligibility checks for Dream Housing Finance based on customer details such as gender, income, credit history, etc., to streamline operations and improve customer satisfaction.  
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Identifying factors that could impact loan approval.  
- **Data Collection**: Using provided datasets to solve the problem.  
- **EDA & Data Pre-processing**: Understanding patterns and preparing the data for model development.  
- **Model Development & Evaluation**: Building and testing classification models to predict loan eligibility.  
- **Conclusion**: Insights gained and recommendations for improving the loan approval process.  

### **Business Context**  
Loan prediction is a common challenge faced by retail banks. Automating this process saves significant time, reduces operational costs, and improves customer satisfaction. The task is to predict the **Loan_Status** (approved or not) using features like income, credit history, and loan amount, thereby enabling the company to minimize the risk of loan defaults.  

This project demonstrates how machine learning can solve real-world classification problems, translating a business problem into a predictive modeling task to drive actionable insights.
